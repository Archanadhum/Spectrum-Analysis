# Spectrum-Allocation analysis
- **Introduction::**
 In June 2024, spectrum auction took place. Leveraging the data provided by the Department of Telecommunications (DOT), I have developed an operator-wise map detailing both existing holdings and the latest purchased spectrum across various frequency bands. This map covers the 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, and 26000 MHz bands.
- **Procedure:** 
**1.** I sourced the data from the DOT and Paragkar.com. Initially, the data was unstructured. My first task was to organize it by categorizing the start and stop frequencies and bandwidth for each operator, circle, and band.
**2.** In Jupiter notebook, I utilized the pandas and matplotlib libraries to create the attached maps. These maps visually represent the operator-band-circle-wise spectrum both existing holdings and the latest purchased spectrum (highlighted in Red colour border) across various frequency bands.
## Tools Used:
**Data Sources:** DOT, Paragkar.com

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib

**Environment:** Jupyter notebook

The attached maps provide a clear and comprehensive view of the spectrum allocation, making it easier to understand the distribution and acquisition of spectrum across different operators and bands.
